# RISOTTO's frontend

This repository hosts the code that builds RISOTTO's frontend.
RISOTTO stands for Research Intelligent Support and Organization TOol against COVID-19 and aims to support COVID-19 research.
More information is available at RISOTTO's homepage: https://inria-chile.github.io/risotto/.

## How to run locally

In order to launch the local development environment, we suggest to use the [integration repository](https://github.com/Inria-Chile/risotto-integration).

If a standalone development server is needed, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
